! Here is a Fortran program to stress test the CPU, utilizing all cores and threads with OpenMP, and reporting the time consumed
! You can change the max_iteration number on line 20
! Compile it with OpenMP support:
!        gfortran -fopenmp -fno-range-check -o CPU_threads_stress_test CPU_threads_stress_test.f90
! Run the program:
!        ./cpu_stress_test
! You can install the latest gfortran release by installing the latest GCC update. (GCC13 is the latest stable release as of January 2025)
