## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a technical portfolio supporting my application for doctoral research (PhD) in Computer Science. 
It bridges the gap between **theoretical cryptography** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** through Algorithm Analysis.

The codebase demonstrates my ability not only to understand complex mathematical protocols but also to implement them efficiently in low-level languages and on parallel computing architectures.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
* **Languages:** C, C++, Fortran, Python, Verilog, Rust, R.
* **HPC & Parallelism:** CUDA (NVIDIA), OpenMP, MPI, Pthreads
* **Hardware Focus:** GPU Acceleration, FPGA (Interest in HLS)
* **Domain:** Cryptographic Primitives, Number Theory, Linear Algebra, Algorithm analysis.
